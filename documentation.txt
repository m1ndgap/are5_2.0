---global:

  -should I put styles into the page folder or the global folder? BEM guidelines say put it in module folders where should I put global styles then?

  -.button max width works, but regular width does not?




index:

---menu:

  -I used absolute positioning for left and rightmost elements to have better control when I'm working on responsive.
  Should they be done as the part of menu flex?

-index_1_intro

basic flex


---index_2_numbers

   -I used two flexboxes inside a flexbox to position four elements in two columns, I wonder if there is a better way to do this
   because adjusting elements seemed tricky and I wasnt able to achieve perfect result


---index_3_experts

  -Is it okay to use numbered font weight? like I do for h2 and its child span?

  -Is it acceptable to use <br> to achieve the same result with text alignment within <p> here?


---index_4_icons

  -instead of doing icons as a span background I should try doing it as a pseudoelement
