— Should I care about how smooth the manual window resizing goes (ie background images not scaling etc.)?
  Do people actually do it or 99.9% of users just open it on a certain viewport and that's it?

— h1 is repeated with minimal variations in each section of the index page, is it okay or should I consolidate it somewhere? There are some changes in every iteration so I have a feeling that it will cause more trouble for me. Which is the correct way here, keeping in mind possible scaling etc.

— If I set margin in % does the % come from the element margin belongs too or the parent?

  - Is using <br> in titles okay like I did here?
  - Is it okay to select the title div with nthchild(1) or should I make it an h3 or something?

  - Is there a way to adjust the select arrow with basic html/css or is it an OS feature?
